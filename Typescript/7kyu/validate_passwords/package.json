  "description": "Oh no! We made a log in system on Codewars but people have been putting random passwords to log in! Your goal for this kata: You must make sure all the passwords are valid, there will be two functions: signIn() and logIn(). signIn() will make a new password. logIn() will make sure that the password given is valid. Example: ``` // Let us say that someone signed in to codewars and their password is \"cracker\". // NOTE: The password will ONLY be a string. signIn(\"cracker\");",
