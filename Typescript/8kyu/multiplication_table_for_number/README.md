Your goal is to return multiplication table for `number` that is always an integer from 1 to 10.

For example, a multiplication table (string) for `number == 5` looks like below:

```
1 _ 5 = 5
2 _ 5 = 10
3 _ 5 = 15
4 _ 5 = 20
5 _ 5 = 25
6 _ 5 = 30
7 _ 5 = 35
8 _ 5 = 40
9 _ 5 = 45
10 _ 5 = 50
```

P. S. You can use `\n` in string to jump to the next line.

Note: newlines should be added between rows, but there should be no trailing newline at the end. If you're unsure about the format, look at the sample tests.
